This Python AI application combines MediaPipe and TensorFlow for effective real-time workout monitoring. It accurately counts exercise reps and provides visual feedback for posture correction. The application utilizes angle calculation algorithms with NumPy for precise motion tracking and analysis during various exercises.

The interface is designed for ease of use, displaying workout progress, rep counts, and corrective advice to enhance user engagement and exercise effectiveness. Currently, the project is being expanded to include a user-friendly frontend and an SQL database integration. This will enable detailed tracking of user progress and personalized feedback, supporting continuous fitness improvement.

This project merges AI technology with practical fitness applications, offering a smart solution for personal workout monitoring.
